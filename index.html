  <p>Hey, it's Maximilian! I'm a computer science student at the University of British Columbia. Recently, I've discovered the ancient Chinese game of Go. It's all about making globally optimal rather than locally optimal decisions.</p>

  <p>During my third year of university, I worked as a teaching assistant and taught a small lab for our school's Algorithms and Data Structures course. I taught essential algorithms such as in-order, pre-order and post-order depth first search, debugged student's C++ programs, reasoned with students about the correctness of sorting algorithms and so much more. I fondly remember late nights in the basement of Computer Science building talking to students about random development in academia and sharing my experience in the industry. Here's what my students had to say about me:</p>
